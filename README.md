# LuciVerse

## Abstract
This abstract highlights the key aspects of the LuciVerse App, which is developed specifically for fans of the TV show Lucifer. The app offers a dynamic and engaging experience, providing users with randomized quotes that are refreshed on each visit. Additionally, users have the ability to contribute their own quotes, reflecting the personalities of their favorite characters. The app also features an informative section that provides an overview of the show, enhancing users' understanding and connection to the series. The LuciVerse App aims to create an immersive platform for fans to explore, enjoy, and actively participate in the world of Lucifer.

## Context
This application was completed over 5 days in Module 3 (week 5) of [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/)'s Front-End Engineering program. The project was built to match the specifications of [this project rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html).

## Technologies used
- React
- Router
- Cypress
- PropTypes
- CSS
- JSX

## Wins
Responsive Design: Successfully incorporated media queries to ensure that the app is visually appealing and functional across different devices and screen sizes. The implementation of responsive design allows users to have a seamless experience regardless of the device they are using.

Project Organization: Maintained a well-organized project structure, including proper file organization, clear naming conventions, and logical separation of components. This approach contributes to efficient development and easier maintenance of the app.

## Challenges
Cypress Testing: Implementing effective Cypress tests posed challenges during the development process. Overcoming issues such as writing comprehensive test cases and dealing with complex interactions required careful planning and debugging. However, by persevering through these challenges, I was able to achieve a robust and reliable testing framework, ensuring the app's quality and stability.


## Improvements
Going forward, some ideal extensions would be: 
  -  A search feature can be implemented to allow users to search quotes by author.
  -  An additional feature of favoriting quotes can be implemented.
